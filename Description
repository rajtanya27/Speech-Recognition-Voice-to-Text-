🧠 Converts speech to text with Google’s Speech Recognition API

🌐 Opens the recognized text in Google Chrome using the webbrowser module

🛠️ Technologies Used
speech_recognition – for converting spoken words to text

pyaudio – for capturing microphone input

webbrowser – to launch Chrome with the recognized input

💡 How It Works
The program listens to your voice through the microphone.

It uses Google’s speech recognition to convert speech to text.

The resulting text is opened in Chrome as a URL or search query.
